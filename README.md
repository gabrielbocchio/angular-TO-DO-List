Angular Drag-and-Drop To-Do List
This is a personal project aimed at enhancing my Angular skills by creating a dynamic to-do list application with drag-and-drop capabilities. The application includes the following features:

Adding new tasks
Cancelling task addition
Editing tasks
Marking tasks as 'checked'
Implementing drag-and-drop functionality for task rearrangement
Through this project, I am practicing and deepening my understanding of Angular while building a functional and interactive to-do list.
